# kick-start-sveltekit
Highly opinionated way to kick start a svelte project from "templates".

It actually heavily use a imperative script to scaffold via [create.sh](./create.sh) at the moment.

Currently this is not flexible at all and it's geared toward my usage.
And there is no plan to make this work in a more flexible way.

If you still would like to use this, then you can either start from this repo and heavily modify the script to match your needs or https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-add might be just what you want.
